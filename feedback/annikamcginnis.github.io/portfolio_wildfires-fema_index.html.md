## AP Style Feedback

- Change "While Trump considers shutting FEMA, wildfires have become more frequent and widespread - as has FEMA aid." to "While Trump considers shutting down FEMA, wildfires have become more frequent and widespread, as has FEMA aid." (Use "shutting down" for clarity; change the dash to a comma.)
- Change "Twenty-nine people were killed, and tens of thousands of residents suddenly found themselves without homes." to "Twenty-nine people were killed, and tens of thousands of residents found themselves without homes." (Remove "suddenly" for conciseness.)
- Change "the kind of once-in-a-century disaster" to "a once-in-a-century disaster" (Remove "the kind of" for conciseness.)
- Add a period at the end of the phrase "more likely" in the sentence "vegetation dries up and fires become more likely" to form a complete sentence.
- Change "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has declared over 1,600 wildfire disasters since 1953" to "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has declared more than 1,600 wildfire disasters since 1953" (Use "more than" for numerical context.)
- Change "Since November 2002, when FEMA started recording the data" to "Since November 2002, when FEMA began recording data" (Use "began" for better clarity and remove "the".)
- Change "the agency has helped over 2,000 communities (divided by zip code) across the nation respond to wildfires." to "the agency has helped more than 2,000 communities across the nation respond to wildfires." (Use "more than" for numerical context; omit "divided by ZIP code" as it is unnecessary.)
- Change "While many of the same places, such as communities around Los Angeles, continue to fall victim to wildfires" to "While many of the same places, such as communities around Los Angeles, continue to be victimized by wildfires" (Use "be victimized by" for clarity.)
- Change "almost 1,000 zip codes that had not experienced any fire from 2002-2019 also had at least one wildfire" to "almost 1,000 ZIP codes that had not experienced any fire from 2002 to 2019 also experienced at least one wildfire" (Use "ZIP codes" and replace the dash with "to" for consistency.)
- Change "FEMA was created in 1979 under the Carter administration and has helped thousands of communities" to "FEMA was created in 1979 under the Carter administration and has assisted thousands of communities" (Use "assisted" for varied vocabulary.)
- Change "also provides millions of Americans flood insurance" to "also provides millions of Americans with flood insurance" (Add "with" for grammatical correctness.)
- Change "in January, President Donald Trump suggested shuttering FEMA" to "in January 2025, President Donald Trump suggested shuttering FEMA" (Add the year for clarity.)
- Change "something state emergency managers have said they don’t have the resources or capabilities to do." to "something state emergency managers said they do not have the resources or capabilities to do." (Use "do not" instead of "don’t" for adherence to AP style.)
- Change "On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said she would recommend Trump 'get rid' of FEMA" to "On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said she would recommend that Trump 'get rid' of FEMA" (Add "that" for grammatical correctness.)
- Change "Since 2002, FEMA has helped about 4,300 cities across the nation respond to wildfires, including providing over $416 million for about 33,000 homeowners and 40,500 renters to make their homes safe and livable again." to "Since 2002, FEMA has assisted about 4,300 cities across the nation in responding to wildfires, including providing more than $416 million for approximately 33,000 homeowners and 40,500 renters to make their homes safe and livable again." (Use "assisted" and "approximately" for consistency.)
- Change "Renters have received around $700-7,500" to "Renters have received between $700 and $7,500" (Use "between" and "and" for clarity in ranges.)
- Change "to increase their resilience to future disasters - critical support" to "to increase their resilience to future disasters; critical support" (Change the dash to a semicolon for proper punctuation.)
- Change "If FEMA is shut or hobbled" to "If FEMA is shut down or weakened" (Change "hobbled" to "weakened" for clarity.)
