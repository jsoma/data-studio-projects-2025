## AP Style Feedback

- Change the headline from "Which Country's Tinned Fish Is Worth" to "Which Country's Tinned Fish Is Worth Buying" for clarity.
- Capitalize "By" in the subtitle for consistency with other headlines (i.e., "By Tiffany Xinran Wang" becomes "By Tiffany Xinran Wang").
- Ensure all chart descriptions in the `<noscript>` tags are clear and concise. For example, change "Tinned sardine from Portugal is the cheapest and has the largest portion." to "A tinned sardine from Portugal offers the cheapest price and the largest portion."
- Change the phrase "Italy has the second cheapest tuna and largest portion." in the second chart's alt text to "Italy offers the second-cheapest tuna and the largest portion."
- For the French mackerel alt text, revise "French mackerel has larger portion for a cheaper price." to "French mackerel provides a larger portion at a cheaper price."
- Revise "Italian anchovy is half the price of Spain's!" in the last chart's alt text to "Italian anchovy costs half of Spain's price."  
- In the descriptions, maintain a parallel structure for comparatives (e.g., ensure terms like "cheapest," "largest," and "cheaper" follow a consistent grammatical pattern).
- Ensure all currency values (if applicable) are consistent in presentation, e.g., use dollar signs or specify the currency type if mentioned.
- Verify that all data in the visualizations corresponds accurately with the accompanying text.
