## AP Style Feedback

- Change "As an early career climate reporter" to "As an early-career climate reporter."
- Change "More floods in my home state equate to more civilians being displaced." to "More floods in my home state result in more civilians being displaced."
- Change "More peaker plants in Virginia mean a higher emission of greenhouse gases." to "More peaker plants in Virginia mean higher emissions of greenhouse gases."
- Change "I was a bit stunned when I came across a group of waddling flightless birds who were having a population surge" to "I was stunned when I came across a group of waddling flightless birds experiencing a population surge."
- Change "the Antarctic Peninsula and sub-Antarctic islands" to "the Antarctic Peninsula and the sub-Antarctic islands."
- Change "Data from Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics" to "Data from the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics."
- Add a comma after "to a flexible diet" in "Nevertheless, Gentoos are highly adaptable to a flexible diet in addition to climate changes."
- Change "chinstrap and adelie penguins" to "chinstrap and Ad√©lie penguins."
- Change "like not belly flopping when diving for food" to "such as not belly-flopping when diving for food."
- Change "Gentoo are the third largest of the penguin species" to "Gentoo penguins are the third largest of the penguin species."
- Change "triangle- shaped features around their head and eyes" to "triangle-shaped features around their heads and eyes."
- Change "Yet both are responding to climate change differently." to "Yet, both are responding to climate change differently."
- Change "A significant example of the chinstrap penguin declining is at Half Moon Island." to "A significant example of the decline in chinstrap penguins is at Half Moon Island."
- Change "Here chinstrap penguin breeding numbers dropped by 47.71% between 1998 and 2007" to "Here, chinstrap penguin breeding numbers dropped by 47.71 percent between 1998 and 2007."
- Change "Data from Penguinmapp doesn't clarify from where the gentoo penguins leave and head to." to "Data from PenguinMAP does not clarify from where the Gentoo penguins leave and to where they head."
- Change "this has not stopped gentoo penguins from breeding in their original colonies either" to "this has not stopped Gentoo penguins from breeding in their original colonies, either."
- Change "Another way scientists measure breeding success is by dividing the number of baby penguins with the number of instances penguins breed." to "Another way scientists measure breeding success is by dividing the number of baby penguins by the number of times penguins breed."
- Change "One example is specific to when gentoo penguins moult, which is the shedding of old features for the new." to "One example relates to when Gentoo penguins molt, which is the shedding of old feathers for new ones."
- Change "Because moulting involves 'two feather layers (double coat) before the old plumage is shed,' research from 2024 suggests that increase in body surface temperature during moutling, along with the rising temperatures, can be challenging for gentoo penguins." to "Because molting involves 'two feather layers (double coat) before the old plumage is shed,' research from 2024 suggests that the increase in body surface temperature during molting, along with rising temperatures, can be challenging for Gentoo penguins."
