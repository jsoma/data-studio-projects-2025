## AP Style Feedback

- Change “I aim to analyze” to “This project analyzes” for a more objective tone.
- Revise “diagnosis delays for people with rare diseases” to “diagnosis delays in patients with rare diseases” for clarity and conciseness.
- Change “increased costs on already so expensive medical costs” to “increased costs associated with already expensive medical treatment” for better flow and clarity.
- Adjust “from 4-5 years, in some cases up to 17 years” to “from four to five years, and in some cases, up to 17 years” to follow AP style for numbers and add clarity.
- Replace “Besides ineffective treatment” with “In addition to ineffective treatment” for improved word choice and transition.
- Remove “such cases lead to” and rephrase to “they also lead to” to enhance sentence structure and readability.
