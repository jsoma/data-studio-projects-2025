- Change “Legislators passed ‘good cause’ eviction laws in April” to “Legislators passed 'good cause' eviction laws in April 2024” for specificity.
- Change “up 12% compared to 2023” to “up 12 percent from 2023” to follow AP style for percentages.
- In “the increase was smaller compared to 2022 and 2023,” change “compared to” to “than” for clarity.

- Change “is not” to “are not” in “the laws include limits on rent increases” for grammatical accuracy.
- Change "based on local inflation rates (although landlords may increase rent by more if they explain why and show evidence of increased costs or repairs)" to "based on local inflation rates, although landlords may increase rent further if they explain why and provide evidence of increased costs or repairs" for clarity and conciseness.
- Change “a variety of buildings” to “several types of buildings” for improved specificity.
- In “including buildings built since 2009 or buildings where a landlord owns less than 10 units throughout the city,” change “less than 10 units throughout the city” to “fewer than 10 units citywide” for correct usage and conciseness.
- Remove “As reported by City and State” and place it after the quote for better citation placement.
- Change the citation format from “City and State” to “City & State” as per AP style.
- Change “he just changed my mind” to “he just changed his mind” for grammatical accuracy.
- Change “NYCHA housing evictions in Queens showed decreases in evictions while the city's rate rose” to “NYCHA housing evictions in Queens showed a decrease while the city's rate rose” for clarity and conciseness.
